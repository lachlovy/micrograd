# micrograd

This repository is inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Neural Networks course: Zero to Hero course. build an engine that can automatically compute the gradient and do the backward process through a computational graph.

Andrej Karpathy's microgard repository is [micrograd - Github](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).
